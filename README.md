# Bivariate-tectonic-discrimination-diagrams-
In this repository you will find some geochemical bivariate tectonic discrimination diagrams for igneous rocks.

This scripts comes with their respective .csv template file.

Note: if you change the template file, please change the name in quotation marks (" ") in the lines 11 and 84 from each file, or well, in the variable D or where you find the command read.csv

If you have any doubt about using this templates you can see the tutorial video in the YouTube page of Platicando de la Tierra (https://www.youtube.com/@platicandodelatierra)

Thanks for using these scripts hope that works for you teaching and research. Keep tune for more diagrams and scripts !
